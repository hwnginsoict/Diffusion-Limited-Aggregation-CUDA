# Diffusion-Limited-Aggregation-CUDA

This is our project in course Parallel and Distributed Programming. Our group include:
- Phan Duc Hung 20214903
- Nguyen Viet Minh 20214917
- Truong Gia Bach 20210087
- Tran Duong Chinh 20210122

Our implementation on C code is in `DLA.c`. Parallel implementation using CUDA is in `DLA.cu`.

To infer the result, we prefer using https://colab.google/ to upload the notebook `DLAproject.ipynb` and connect to a GPU server. Other setup in local device will need an NDIVIA GPU and install `nvcc` package.

In the `DLAproject.ipynb`, we have already set up all the code for writing `DLA.c` file, `DLA.cu` file and also code to infer, visualize the map, check two outputs.
